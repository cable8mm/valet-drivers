This repository provides custom drivers for both [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet) and [Laravel Herb](https://github.com/laravel-herb/herb), enabling support for frameworks and tools not officially supported out of the box.

## ðŸ§° What is Laravel Valet?

Laravel Valet is a super-fast development environment for macOS (and Linux via Valet Linux), designed for PHP developers. It runs as a local web server using Nginx and DnsMasq to automatically serve projects under a .test domain. Valet is lightweight and ideal for those who prefer minimal overhead without using full virtual machines or Docker.

Laravel Herb is a modern alternative to Valet that provides an isolated and Docker-powered environment, while keeping the simplicity and speed of Valet-style development.

## âœ… Supported Drivers

- [x] CakePHP 2 â€“ Legacy PHP MVC framework
- [x] ZeroBoard â€“ Classic Korean bulletin board system
- [x] Vite â€“ Modern frontend build tool (for serving Vite projects in dev mode)

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Plug-and-play support for Valet and Herb
- Auto-detection of project type based on directory structure
- Smooth local development without extra configuration

Whether you're maintaining old-school PHP applications or building fast modern frontends, these custom drivers make local development effortless with both Valet and Herb.
